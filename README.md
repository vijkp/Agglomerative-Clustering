Benchmarking Graph database/processing systems for Agglomerative Clustering
===========================================================================
Graph data is getting increasingly popular in, e.g. text processing, social 
networks etc. Over the years it has lead to the development of various graph 
databases and graph processing systems. A recent study by [8] benchmarks the 
graph and relational databases. However, according to our knowledge there 
has been no study on benchmarking graph databases and graph processing 
systems to compare their performance. Therefore our proposal is novel in 
terms of a benchmark study. In this paper we take one of the most expensive
data mining technique i.e. clustering, to benchmark the two systems. Since 
personal social networks are big and cluttered, clustering is an effective 
technique to organize and find out community structure within the social 
network graphs. We are using Neo4j and GraphLab as our graph database and 
graph processing system respectively.
