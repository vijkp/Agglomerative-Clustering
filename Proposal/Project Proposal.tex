\begin{answer}{Problem statement:}
In this project, we are presenting a comprehensive study to compare graph databases performance on a graph clustering algorithm. The data will be generated through synthetic graph data generators. We have specified this generator in the last section of proposal.
\end{answer}

\begin{answer}{Goal and motivation:}
Graph data management has been receiving a lot of attention with the arrival of various social networks like facebook, twitter, google+ etc. All these networks have their data stored in some or the other form of graph database, which can scale up to billions of nodes. Graph databases process relationship information between nodes and their efficiency running queries making Relational databases obsolete. Social networks are flooded with online communities, which are formed based on some similarity between the users.
\\\\
However, there is no comprehensive study to measure performance of community detection algorithms in the context of various graph databases.
\\\\
Therefore, we have two motivations for doing this project:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Clustering a synthetic social network graph on graph databases to detect network communities. For accomplishing this task, we will be implementing standard agglomerative clustering with various cluster quality measures to form clusters.
	\item
	We will do the performance evaluation of graph databases in terms of time of execution and memory usage for the clustering algorithm. It will provide a benchmark for future users and an opportunity to select the appropriate graph database based on how its performance metrics.
	\item 
	We also would like to study the scalability of graph databases as data grows in orders of magnitude using clustering as the task.
	\end{enumerate}
In one of the benchmarking task [8], author has compared performance of Page Rank and Shortest Paths on graph database and relational database. Therefore our proposal is novel in terms of task compared.
\end{answer}

\begin{answer}{Ambitious goal:}
	If time permits, we plan to implement and evaluate our algorithm on PEGASUS: A peta-scale graph mining system.
\end{answer}

\begin{answer}{Survery of related work:}
Hierarchical clustering algorithm has been studied([1][2][3]) for over decades now. Also there have been many of its successful implementations for various applications([4][5]). In addition to that, many researchers have evaluated different types of hierarchical algorithms (list of algo survey papers) but most of the results were presented on smaller datasets. As the data sizes grow for network graphs these algorithms are implemented on graph databases and there is a very little literature ([6]) on the implementation and evaluation of these clustering algorithms on large datasets using graph database systems. The goal of the project is to study the performance of graph database systems running clustering algorithms on large datasets.
